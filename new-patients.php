		<h2 class="cap"><em>New Patients:</em></h2>
		<p>At this time new patients from 0 to 18 years of age are being accepted into the practice.  Health care services are provided to all our clients through their twenty-first year or until completion of college.  If you have any questions regarding our ability to meet the needs of your child, please call the office (410-601-8383) so that we may assist you. While we do accept most health insurance, please call our office to confirm that we accept yours.</p>
		<p>Upon transferring to our practice, please schedule an appointment so that we can meet and discuss your child's health history, present health status and any concerns you may have.  It is important to know your child so that we can prevent health problems occurring, when ever possible.</p>
		<p>At the first visit, please bring along a copy of your child's vaccination records and health insurance cards.  Please also arrange transfer of medical records when possible.  A parent or legal guardian must sign a consent for 'release of medical recordsâ€™, which should be sent to the current provider, in order to arrange this transfer.  Many insurance companies will require you to inform them of a change in primary care provider.  Please ensure that this is done if required, to avoid billing issues.</p>

		<h2 class="cap"><em>Expectant Parents:</em></h2>
		<p><em>Congratulations!</em>  The birth of a baby is an exciting but often-anxious time for parents.  It is important to find a health care provider that you feel comfortable with and can trust to provide the very best care for your baby.  We strongly suggest, when possible, that you make an appointment and come meet with Dr. Caplan prior to the arrival of your baby. </p>
